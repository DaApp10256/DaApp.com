<h3>Hello, everyone enjoying my website (or at least I hope enjoying.) I am currently still a child but, maybe when people find out about this website I'll be older. My name is Crisanto Carrillo and I am a person who loved coding and programming and if you did not know, DaApp.com was actually made for a summer camp project. The camp I made this project in was the DaVinci Coding and Game Design camp. You guys might think why I have the old Epic Face meme on my website. The reason is because The App. The App is a fictional being I made that looked like the Epic Face. Information about this being is mostly unknown which only I know about it. Sadly, because it's a secret I can not tell you. Continuing about me, I have not always loved coding my whole life. When I was younger than my age now I used to want to be a vetenerian. The reason I did not go for that dream is because I noticed how frightening animals could be when I became a little older. Well, that is all I could really tell you about me because, I think this might be a boring subject to read anyways. So here, I say Goodbye and enjoy DaApp.com.
